📘 PROJECT BLUEPRINT v2.0 — Nigerian Digital Tax Assistant (WhatsApp + Web + AI RAG)
________________________________________
1. Project Vision
To build Nigeria’s most accessible digital tax tool: an AI-powered assistant that offers tax information, personalized guidance, multi-income categorization, semi-automated filing support, document interpretation, deadline reminders, Virtual Tax Clinics, and optional human consultation.
Accessible through WhatsApp and Web, it provides clarity across different income streams and empowers individuals, freelancers, and businesses to comply with tax requirements easily, affordably, and confidently.
Long-term, the platform enables tax professionals and partner firms to support clients through a marketplace ecosystem.

2. Core Problem Summary
The Nigerian tax system is fragmented, opaque, and intimidating.
Citizens don’t understand PIT, VAT, or WHT. SMEs struggle with compliance and documentation. Expertise is expensive and hard to access.
The upcoming 2026 tax reforms will increase confusion.
Most Nigerians already rely on WhatsApp, not traditional web platforms.
There is no personalized, trustworthy, always-available tax assistant for the mass market.________________________________________
